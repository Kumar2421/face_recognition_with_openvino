Project Title: Face Recognition Attendance System

Short Description
A real-time face recognition attendance system leveraging Intel's OpenVINO toolkit and OpenCV for accurate and efficient detection. This project is designed to handle large groups of individuals in varying conditions, ensuring reliable attendance tracking.

Key Features
Real-Time Processing: Detect and recognize faces instantly for seamless attendance.
Scalability: Efficiently handles large employee groups with minimal latency.
Robustness: Accurate recognition even in challenging conditions such as low light, weather variations, or dynamic environments.
Cross-Platform Support: Runs efficiently on multiple devices and platforms.
Integration-Ready: Easily integrates with existing databases for automated attendance logs.
Technologies Used
OpenVINO Toolkit: Optimized deep learning inference for face detection and recognition.
OpenCV: Image processing and face recognition handling.
Python: Backend scripting and integration.
How It Works
Preprocessing: Captures video feed from an IP camera and preprocesses the frames.
Face Detection: Uses OpenVINO-optimized models for detecting faces.
Feature Extraction: Extracts unique facial features for recognition using pre-trained models.
Recognition: Matches detected faces with a database of employee records.
Attendance Logging: Logs recognized faces into the attendance database in real-time.
